# Expo CLI Startup Failure: An Uncommon Error

This repository demonstrates a rare issue encountered when starting an Expo project using the Expo CLI. The problem manifests as a cryptic error message during the project's initialization or start-up phase, often not revealing the root cause directly.

## Reproduction

The specific steps to reproduce this issue might vary depending on your environment. However, common factors include:

* Using outdated versions of Expo CLI.
* Incompatibilities between Expo CLI, Expo Go, and project dependencies (e.g., React Native).
* Unexpected configurations within the project's `package.json` or `app.json` files.

## Solution

The provided solution involves several strategies to address the underlying causes of the startup failure:

1. **Update Expo CLI:** Ensure you have the latest version of Expo CLI installed.
2. **Check Dependencies:** Verify that all project dependencies (especially React Native) are compatible with your Expo CLI and Expo Go versions.
3. **Clean Project:**  Sometimes, cached files or build artifacts can cause issues. Try cleaning the project cache.
4. **Review Configurations:** Carefully examine your `package.json` and `app.json` files to ensure that all settings are correctly configured and compatible.
5. **Examine Logs:**  Examine the complete logs generated during the startup process for any additional clues or specific error messages.
